    description: `“KIKOF” is a product brand that KIGI founded jointly with “Mother Lake Products”, an organization where craftsmen from Shiga Prefecture gather under the theme of “Lake Biwa is a big vessel in Japan”. Around Lake Biwa, which occupies about one-sixth of the prefecture’s soil in Shiga Prefecture, lush mountains and rural scenery spread, and craftsmen such as pottery, crepe, hemp, woodwork, lacquer, and Buddhist altars continue to make things. Next to Kyoto, which has long been the center of Japanese culture, it was also an important transportation hub, and various manufacturing activities have developed. In recent years, we faced the problem of lack of successors to inherit the technology cultivated over many years due to the decrease in demand, but by incorporating a design with modern ideas into the technology of traditional crafts and production areas KIKOF was born to want to make waves. KIKOF is the name of “Kakoko＝Kiko” with the initial letter F of the word indicating the direction of the brand such as Free, Full, Fly, Future. This is a project that aims to create things from the lake that is the mother of Japan, and to inherit the traditional culture without interruption.`,

    description: `FIKA means “coffee time with loved friends and people” in Swedish. ‘Lindvalls Kaffee’ from 100% Swedish which is called the Swedish royal coffee as a motto, to Swedish jam with a unique taste, desserts made using a Swedish recipe and flavored with only herbs and pure ingredients are a gift for loved ones. It contains the heart that thinks about the health. To solidify this spirit, FIKA offers fresh, healthy food. and to provide a Nordic bakery, each branch has a chef to provide freshly baked bread and desserts every day. The ultimate reason for launching Swedish Cafe “FIKA” in Korea-Seoul was to introduce Swedish culture and to make Nordic culture familiar to people. In addition to traditional Swedish bakery, coffee, and soul food, I made business cards, interior walls of cafes, and goods by drawing illustrations of Swedish architecture, Swedish traditional wooden doll Dalahäst, etc. I hoped it would lead to Nordic culture experience to Korean customers.`,

    description:
      'Wine and Coffee House is a coffee-making and alcoholic beverage company founded in Berlin for three generations. At first, the concept of the cafe was inconsistent and unorganized. Although the cafe and wine shop are separate, they are actually one and the same company. For that reason, I thought about making a logo that felt the same even though it was a different industry. After long consideration, I selected a coffee bean sac and wine barrel that preserves coffee beans and alcohol as the main logo, and created the logo by hand-drawing to feel the long history in line with the image of the company with a history of about 70 years. Both the coffee shop and wine shop logos connote the meaning of "to contain". Based on the cafe\'s menu board, takeaway package, goods product (bamboo eco cup), tableware, linen bag of the wine shop, and also the overall branding colour of the cafe, it plays a role in giving a sense of unity to the atmosphere of the former cafe, which was crowded.',
